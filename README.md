    Growing up,I was the wacky kid that would come up with software projects among his peers and would be called the computer guy. I was always up to the challenge of handling everyone’s computer problems.
These days, I’m on a constant battle with bugs. 
Luckily, I have developed particular skills to drop those little creatures and I have yet to lose a fight. With this new acquired knowledge, I have been able to use my skills to develop creative and innovative software. One of my most recent projects involved the analysis of a twitter feed that acquires all available vaccine appointments in Canada. My project allows users to find Covid-19 vaccine appointments by inputting their age and geographical information to obtain the most optimal results. 

In my spare time, you could find me on GitHub trying to learn new technical skills, working on new open source projects, or just browsing the internet of upcoming projects. My skills include that of Back End Development with OOP Principles, Software Design, and web development using new technologies.

If you want to know more about me, shoot me a message or reach out to me at ahmedwal@my.yorku.ca.
